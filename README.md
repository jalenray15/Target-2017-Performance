# ðŸŽ¯ Target 2017 Sales & Logistics Performance Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Background
As a data analyst at Target, I was tasked with analyzing 2017 sales and logistics performance (fictional data) to provide actionable insights for business growth and operational efficiency. This project includes two interconnected dashboards:

Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ Evaluating revenue trends, product category performance, and sales KPIs.

Logistics Performance Dashboard â€“ Monitoring delivery efficiency, shipping costs, and on-time performance.


### **Key Business Questions Addressed**
The analysis focuses on two key areas:

**Sales Performance**
1. **Monthly Sales Trends** â€“ Identifying seasonality and growth patterns.
2. **Top-Selling Product Categories** â€“ Understanding which product categories drive revenue.
3. **Low-Selling Product Categories** â€“ Identifying underperforming categories.
4. **Sales KPIs** â€“ Evaluating KPIs like total sales, total orders, and average order value.

**Logistics Performance**
1. **Delivery Performance Over Time** â€“ Assessing on-time vs. late deliveries and trends.
2. **Shipping Cost vs. Delivery Speed** â€“ Evaluating cost-effectiveness in logistics.
3. **Delivery Time by State** â€“ Identifying regional inefficiencies in shipment handling.
4. **High-Risk Locations** â€“ Finding the top states with the most late deliveries to pinpoint areas for improvement.
